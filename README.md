# Heart Disease Predictive Analysis
This project takes a heart disease dataset and makes predictions based on it using Machine Learning.

## Technology Used
- Python (Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, 
- Machine Learning Models such as:
  - Bagging Meta-Estimator, Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron
 
## The Analytic Pipeline
1. Data Transformation - Renamed columns to make for better readability.
2. Feature Engineering - Featues which didn't have an impact on the label were removed
3. Principal Component Analysis - Applied PCA to ensure a high quality of features
4. Model Selection - A suitable algorithm was chosen to be trained into a model
5. Supervised ML - The algorithm was trained into a suitable model 
6. Model Testing - The newly created model was tested using some actual data and dummy data
